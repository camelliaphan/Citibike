# Citibike

This project started with each of us trying to come up with 2 hypothesis based on the citibike database that we think are interesting. 
Then after discussion, we decided to take Zhang's idea about finding a correlation between distance to parks and frequencies of citibike usage. 
While Ramda was working on building a new csv file that collects only the columns with relevant information, Zhang and I 
worked on writing down our idea, our hypothesis and our chosen method of analysis. 
Since Ramda did a great contribute, i.e creating the csv file that our group would work on, Zhang and I decided that the two of us
were responsible for the rest of the project. I took on the job of writing the code to count the data that we will later use for analysis
(ie. distance and frequencies) and did the visualization of the data, while Zhang did the analysis based on the data. 
This is a very great teamwork experience, not only in terms of how smoothly the project was done since we divided the workload 
quite fairly, but also I learnt a lot from Ramda, and the way he went through the citibike dataset and the parks dataset and came up
with a new csv file that contains only the information that we need. It is definitely a learning experience!
